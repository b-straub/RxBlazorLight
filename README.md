# RxBlazorLight

> **Note:** This project has been superseded by [RxBlazorV2](https://github.com/b-straub/RxBlazorV2), which provides a more powerful reactive programming framework with Roslyn source generators, automatic component generation, and improved DI integration.

*RxBlazorLight* is a simple reactive wrapper around Blazor components.

For now only [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) components are supported.

Build the [RxMudBlazorLightSample](https://github.com/b-straub/RxBlazorLight/tree/main/RxMudBlazorLightSample) and enjoy the reactive [Components](https://github.com/b-straub/RxBlazorLight/tree/main/RxMudBlazorLightTestBase/Components).

**The API can change anytime!**

Currently, I use this library for my [DexieNETCloudSample](https://github.com/b-straub/DexieNET/tree/master/DexieNETCloudSample).

Comments about other use cases and feature requests are very welcome!
