# RxBlazorLight

*RxBlazorLight* is a simple reactive wrapper around Blazor components.

For now only [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/) components are supported.

Build the [RxMudBlazorLightSample](https://github.com/b-straub/RxBlazorLight/tree/main/RxMudBlazorLightSample) and enjoy the reactive [Components](https://github.com/b-straub/RxBlazorLight/tree/main/RxMudBlazorLightTestBase/Components).

**The API can change anytime!**

Currently I use this library for my [DexieNETCloudSample](https://github.com/b-straub/DexieNET/tree/cloud/DexieNETCloudSample).

Comments about other use cases and feature requests are very welcome!
